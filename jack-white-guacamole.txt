Ingredients:
 - 8 x large, ripe Haas avocados (cut in half the long way, remove the pit—SAVE
   THE PIT THOUGH—, and dice into large cubes with a butter knife. 3 or 4 slits
   down, 3 or 4 across. You'll scoop out the chunks with a spoon, careful to 
   maintain the avocado in fairly large chunks.)
 - 4 x vine-ripened tomatoes (diced)
 - 1/2 x yellow onion (finely chopped)
 - 1 x full bunch cilantro (chopped)
 - 4 x Serrano peppers (de-veined and chopped)
 - 1 x lime
 - Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
 1. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl, careful not to mush the avocados too 
 much. We want it chunky.
 2. Once properly mixed and tested, add the pits into the guacamole and even 
 out the top with a spoon or spatula.
 3. Add 1/2 lime to the top later so you cover most of the surface with the 
 juice (The pits and lime will keep it from browning prematurely.)
 4. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until served.
 5. Please don't make it too early before it's served. We'd love to have it 
 around 5 p.m.
